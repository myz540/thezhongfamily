# thezhongfamily
thezhongfamily domain is my sandbox and playground for all things web development

thezhongfamily is a django project and currently consists of (3) applications:

1) People (in dev.) - blog, wall, bios for family members. Still needs a lot of work and front-end.
2) Catan (in dev.) - Settlers of Catan implementation. Currently only the backend is built, needs front-end and more testing.
3) Twitter_bot (in dev.) - tweepy twitter bot, currently set up to mine DJT's tweets and scan for mentions of publicly traded companies. Plan to implement sentiment analysis and NLTK analysis to quantify the impact his tweet's have on stock and ETF prices. Eventually would like to implement trading strategies and evaluate their effectiveness
